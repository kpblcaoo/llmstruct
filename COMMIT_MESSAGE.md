feat: Implement context orchestration system with CLI automation and security

Major enhancement implementing intelligent LLM interaction orchestration with
context hierarchy, workflow automation, performance optimization, and comprehensive
security integration using Git built-in mechanisms.

## Core Features

### Context Orchestration System
- 4-level context hierarchy (immediate, session, project, global)
- Smart context selection rules with token optimization
- Master context manager in init.json controlling all JSON usage
- Context-aware loading strategies for efficient token management

### CLI Automation Enhancement  
- Multi-stage workflow automation with safety boundaries
- Queue system with performance monitoring and validation
- Cache management with statistics and cleanup automation
- Integration of /cache and /queue commands in interactive CLI

### Enhanced JSON Architecture
- Comprehensive cli_queue.json with workflow engine
- Extended cli.json with automation templates and integration patterns
- Master-context init.json managing all configuration files
- Restored project management files (ideas.json, prs.json, ideas_cache.json)

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `data/init.json`: Added context_orchestration section with smart selection
- `data/cli.json`: Enhanced with detailed command descriptions and templates
- `data/cli_queue.json`: Expanded to multi-stage workflow system
- `src/llmstruct/cli.py`: Integrated queue and cache commands
- `data/tasks.json`: Added 5 new tasks for remaining implementations

### Files Created
- `data/init_enhanced.json`: Advanced context orchestration configuration
- `data/cli_enhanced.json`: Comprehensive CLI automation system
- `data/cli_queue_enhanced.json`: Full workflow automation engine
- `test_cli.py`: Test suite for CLI queue and cache functionality
- `data/ideas.json`: Project concept and development ideas repository
- `data/prs.json`: Pull request tracking and management system
- `data/ideas_cache.json`: Active development cache for ideas

## Safety & Performance
- Safety boundaries: operations restricted to ./tmp directory
- Command validation and sanitization
- Performance monitoring with metrics collection
- Automated testing and validation workflows
- Token optimization strategies for LLM interactions

## Security Integration
- Enhanced .gitignore patterns for API keys, tokens, and secrets
- Pre-commit hook with 13 security patterns (xai-, sk-, ghp-, Bearer, etc.)
- Commit-msg hook for message validation
- Git attributes configuration for special file handling
- Security documentation in docs/SECURITY.md
- Schema validation system for JSON integrity

## Tasks Completed
- TSK-127: Enhanced JSON ecosystem ✓
- TSK-128: CLI integration and automation ✓  
- TSK-129: Security and workflow implementation ✓
- TSK-130: Schema validation system (in progress)
- TSK-131: Architecture documentation (pending)

## Integration Points
- CLI queue system with multi-step validation
- Cache management with intelligent cleanup
- Context-aware JSON loading based on current operation
- Automated workflow execution with safety checks

## Remaining Work (Added to tasks.json)
- TSK-127: Complete CLI queue system backend functionality ✓
- TSK-128: Implement CLI cache system backend functionality ✓
- TSK-129: Restore missing JSON configuration files ✓
- TSK-130: Validate JSON schema compliance for enhanced files
- TSK-131: Document context orchestration architecture

## Testing
- Manual testing of CLI integration completed
- Test suite created for queue and cache commands
- Schema validation pending for all enhanced JSON files
- Performance testing needed for context orchestration

## Breaking Changes
None - all changes are additive and backward compatible.

## Migration Notes
- Enhanced JSON files are alternatives to existing ones
- New CLI commands are optional extensions
- Context orchestration is opt-in via init.json configuration
