# Phase 1.8: Multi-tenant & Security

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED**  
**Priority:** P1 (Enables multi-project workflows)  
**Duration:** 3-4 weeks  
**Started:** TBD  
**Target Completion:** TBD  
**Branch:** `phase1.8-multi-tenant`  
**Base:** `phase1.7-llm-integration`

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

Phase 1.8 builds on the single-tenant LLM integration from Phase 1.7 to create a production-ready multi-tenant system with advanced security, proxy capabilities, and Docker-based deployment.

**Key Focus:** Implement Node.js/TypeScript middleware/proxy for multi-tenant operation, project registry, security features, and multi-container Docker architecture. Enable Cursor and external clients to work with multiple projects through a secure, extensible proxy layer.

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- [ ] **Multi-tenant Architecture:** Node.js/TS middleware supports multiple projects (project_id â†’ struct_path)
- [ ] **Security:** Project registry, white-list, enum, authentication, authorization implemented
- [ ] **Proxy Integration:** Cursor and external clients work through proxy (multi-project support)
- [ ] **Docker Architecture:** Multi-container setup (middleware + llmstruct) with shared volumes
- [ ] **Performance:** < 500ms proxy overhead, supports 10+ concurrent projects
- [ ] **Extensibility:** Easy to add new MCP tools, integrations, security features
- [ ] **Production Ready:** Logging, monitoring, error handling, graceful degradation

**Dependencies:** Phase 1.7 completion  
**Deliverables:** Production-ready multi-tenant system with security and Docker deployment  
**Success Metrics:** 10+ concurrent projects, < 500ms proxy overhead, enterprise-grade security
