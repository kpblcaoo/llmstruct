# 🎯 Cursor Evaluation - Immediate Action Plan

**Created**: 2025-05-28T12:00:00Z  
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes focused testing  
**Objective**: Compare Cursor vs GitHub Copilot on real llmstruct development  

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE SETUP (5 minutes)

### 1. Current State Check
```bash
cd /home/kpblc/projects/github/llmstruct
git status
git stash  # if needed
git checkout feature/focused-mode-optimization
```

### 2. Baseline Measurement Setup
```bash
# Time the current context generation
time python -c "
from src.llmstruct.cli_core import create_cli_core
cli = create_cli_core()
context = cli.copilot.get_context('FOCUSED')
print(f'Context size: {len(context)} chars')
"
```

---

## 🔥 TEST TASK: Issue #20 - FOCUSED Mode Optimization

### Target Files to Modify:
```
src/llmstruct/copilot_context_manager.py  # Main optimization target
src/llmstruct/cli_core.py                 # Integration point
test_context_orchestration.py             # Validation
```

### Specific Optimization Goals:
1. **Reduce context generation time by 20-30%**
2. **Maintain context quality (all essential info preserved)**  
3. **Add smart caching for repeated context requests**
4. **Improve memory efficiency**

## 📊 CURSOR VS COPILOT COMPARISON

### Testing Methodology:
1. **GitHub Copilot Phase** (20 minutes)
   - Implement optimization using current setup
   - Record time, keystrokes, suggestions quality
   
2. **Cursor Phase** (20 minutes)  
   - Same task, fresh approach with Cursor
   - Compare multi-file awareness and suggestions

3. **Results Comparison** (10 minutes)
   - Performance metrics
   - Code quality assessment
   - Developer experience notes

### Metrics to Track:
```yaml
Development_Metrics:
  - Implementation time: Target <30 minutes
  - Lines of code changed: Estimate 20-50 lines
  - AI suggestions accepted: Count ratio
  - Context switches: Number of file switches
  - Bugs introduced: Count and severity

AI_Assistance_Quality:
  - Suggestion relevance: 1-10 scale
  - Multi-file awareness: Does it understand project context?
  - Code completion accuracy: Syntax and logic correctness
  - Refactoring suggestions: Quality of optimization ideas

Developer_Experience:
  - Learning curve: How fast to get productive?
  - Workflow integration: VS Code extension quality
  - Performance: Response time and system load
  - Documentation: Inline help and guidance
```

## 💻 SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

### Task 1: Context Generation Optimization
**File**: `src/llmstruct/copilot_context_manager.py`

**Current Pain Point**: 
```python
# Slow path - loads everything every time
def get_context(self, mode="FOCUSED"):
    # Expensive operations that can be cached
    pass
```

**Optimization Strategy**:
1. Add intelligent caching layer
2. Implement lazy loading for large data
3. Optimize JSON parsing and filtering
4. Add performance monitoring

### Task 2: Smart Caching Implementation  
**Expected Addition**:
```python
class ContextCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self._cache = {}
        self._cache_stats = {}
    
    def get_cached_context(self, mode, cache_key):
        # Smart caching logic
        pass
        
    def invalidate_cache(self, trigger):
        # Intelligent cache invalidation
        pass
```

### Task 3: Performance Monitoring
**Integration Point**: `src/llmstruct/cli_core.py`
```python
@performance_monitor
def get_context_with_metrics(self, mode):
    # Wrapped context generation with timing
    pass
```

---

## 🧪 VALIDATION PLAN

### Before Implementation:
```bash
# Baseline performance test
python test_context_orchestration.py --benchmark --mode=FOCUSED
```

### During Implementation:
- Monitor AI suggestion quality in real-time
- Track development velocity and flow state
- Note any friction points or advantages

### After Implementation:
```bash
# Performance validation
python test_context_orchestration.py --benchmark --mode=FOCUSED --compare-baseline

# Quality validation  
python -m pytest test_context_orchestration.py -v --cov=src/llmstruct/copilot_context_manager
```

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ 20-30% improvement in context generation speed
- ✅ No regression in context quality
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Memory usage stable or improved
