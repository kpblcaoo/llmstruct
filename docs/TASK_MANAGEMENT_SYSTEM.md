## 🚀 HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM

### **For Humans** 👨‍💻

#### **Daily Workflow**:
1. **Morning**: Check `PRIORITY_DASHBOARD.md` for today's critical actions
2. **Planning**: Review current week/month goals and deadlines
3. **Execution**: Follow tier-based priority system (TIER 1 → TIER 2 → TIER 3)
4. **Evening**: Update success tracking checkboxes

#### **Weekly Planning**:
1. **Review Progress**: Check completed tasks against goals
2. **Update Priorities**: Adjust based on market feedback/results
3. **Resource Planning**: Align effort with revenue milestones
4. **Risk Assessment**: Monitor competitive threats and technical challenges

#### **Monthly Strategy**:
1. **Roadmap Review**: Assess strategic roadmap progress
2. **Metric Analysis**: Evaluate KPIs and success metrics
3. **Pipeline Planning**: Adjust execution timeline based on results
4. **Resource Allocation**: Plan team/infrastructure scaling

### **For LLMs** 🤖

#### **Task Discovery Protocol**:
```python
# When user requests task analysis:
1. Run: python scripts/create_tasks_index.py
2. Review: docs/TASKS_SUMMARY.md for overview
3. Check: docs/PRIORITY_DASHBOARD.md for current priorities
4. Reference: docs/STRATEGIC_ROADMAP_2025.md for context
```

#### **Priority Assessment Framework**:
```yaml
Task_Evaluation_Criteria:
  revenue_impact: "1-10 scale (immediate revenue potential)"
  strategic_value: "1-10 scale (long-term positioning)"
  technical_complexity: "1-10 scale (implementation difficulty)"
  deadline_urgency: "1-10 scale (time sensitivity)"
  resource_requirements: "1-10 scale (effort needed)"
  
Priority_Formula:
  TIER_1: "revenue_impact >= 8 OR deadline_urgency >= 9"
  TIER_2: "strategic_value >= 7 AND complexity <= 6"
  TIER_3: "innovation_showcase OR future_enhancement"
```

#### **Response Guidelines for LLMs**:
```yaml
When_User_Asks_About_Tasks:
  1. Reference current dashboard priorities
  2. Check for critical deadlines (like T-Pot deployment)
  3. Suggest specific actionable next steps
  4. Link to relevant strategic context
  
When_Planning_New_Work:
  1. Check against existing roadmap
  2. Assess impact on current priorities  
  3. Suggest integration with strategic goals
  4. Recommend documentation updates
  
When_User_Needs_Focus:
  1. Highlight TIER 1 critical items
  2. Suggest time-boxed execution blocks
  3. Provide success criteria
  4. Offer progress tracking methods
```

## 🎯 STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES

### **Decision Making Framework**:
```yaml
When_Choosing_Tasks:
  1. "Critical deadline first" (like T-Pot deployment)
  2. "Revenue generator priority" (TIER 1 items)
  3. "Strategic value assessment" (long-term positioning)
  4. "Resource optimization" (maximum impact per effort)
  
When_Adding_New_Tasks:
  1. "Strategic alignment check" (fits roadmap?)
  2. "Priority queue assessment" (displaces what?)
  3. "Resource impact analysis" (realistic timeline?)
  4. "Documentation requirement" (update system?)
```

### **Execution Philosophy**:
```yaml
Focus_Principles:
  - "One critical deadline at a time"
  - "Complete before starting new"
  - "Document everything for scaling"
  - "Measure progress continuously"
  
Scaling_Approach:
  - "Build systems, not just features"
  - "Automate repetitive planning"
  - "Enable team contribution"
  - "Maintain strategic coherence"
```

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING & OPTIMIZATION

### **Common Issues**:
```yaml
Task_Overload:
  symptom: "Too many TIER 1 items"
  solution: "Reassess priorities, delegate, or defer"
  
Planning_Paralysis:
  symptom: "Spending too much time planning"
  solution: "Time-box planning sessions, focus on execution"
  
Context_Switching:
  symptom: "Jumping between unrelated tasks"
  solution: "Batch similar tasks, complete before switching"
```

### **Optimization Strategies**:
```yaml
Batching:
  - Group similar tasks (documentation, coding, planning)
  - Execute in focused time blocks
  - Minimize context switching overhead
  
Automation:
  - Automate index generation and updates
  - Use templates for recurring planning
  - Script routine maintenance tasks
  
Delegation:
  - Identify tasks suitable for team members
  - Create clear handoff documentation
  - Maintain oversight and quality control
