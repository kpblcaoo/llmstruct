# llmstruct Manifesto

**Mission**: Create a dev tool that simplifies development through universal JSON and LLMs. `struct.json` is your partner, preserving context, saving resources, and improving code quality. Our goal: enable every developer to say, “Buddy, make the code great!”

**Principles**:  
- **Dogfooding**: We build `llmstruct` using `llmstruct`, proving its power.  
- **Transparency**: Tasks, ideas, metrics in `struct.json`, Issues, RFCs. Fully open under GPL-3.0.  
- **Idempotence**: Same code, same result. Reliable for LLMs and developers.  
- **Ease of Use**: From CLI to UI, from `/fix` in Telegram to voice commands—development as a dialogue.  

**Vision**: `struct.json` as the standard for code, tasks, and context. LLMs as your smart assistant, not a black box.
