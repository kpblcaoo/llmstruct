# llmstruct Manifesto

**Mission**: Create a tool for developers and DevOps that simplifies and automates development through universal JSON and LLMs. `struct.json` is your partner, preserving context, automating CI/CD, and improving code. Our goal: enable everyone to say, “Buddy, make code and processes great!”

**Principles**:  
- **Dogfooding**: We build `llmstruct` using `llmstruct`, proving its power.  
- **Transparency**: Tasks, ideas, metrics in `struct.json`, Issues, RFCs. Fully open under GPL-3.0.  
- **Idempotence**: Same code, same result. Reliable for LLMs, CI, and developers.  
- **Automation**: From code parsing to Issues and metrics in Grafana—less routine, more coding.  
- **Integration**: Works with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab), DevOps (Grafana, MLflow), and IDEs (Continue).  

**Vision**: `struct.json` as the standard for code, tasks, and processes. LLMs and CI as your smart assistants, not black boxes.
