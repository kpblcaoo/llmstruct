# LLMStruct Decision Checklist

Use this checklist to assess whether the LLMStruct project is worth continuing or risks becoming an unused standard. Review every 1–2 months or after major milestones.

## Problem Validation
- [ ] Have I tested LLM responses with `struct.json` vs. without, showing clear improvements (e.g., accuracy, relevance)?
- [ ] Are there user stories or case studies demonstrating value (e.g., faster onboarding, better refactoring)?
- [ ] Is the LLM integration use case still relevant given advancements in AI tools?

## Differentiation
- [ ] Does LLMStruct offer unique features compared to AST tools, LSP, or static analyzers?
- [ ] Have I identified 1–2 killer use cases (e.g., LLM-driven refactoring) that competitors don’t address?
- [ ] Are integrations planned with popular tools (e.g., VS Code, GitHub Actions)?

## Adoption
- [ ] Is the project published on GitHub with clear docs and examples?
- [ ] Have I shared it with potential users (e.g., via X, Reddit, or dev communities)?
- [ ] Are there early adopters or contributors (e.g., for new parsers)?
- [ ] Do I have metrics (e.g., stars, downloads, feedback) indicating interest?

## Scalability and Maintenance
- [ ] Is the codebase modular and easy to extend (e.g., new parsers)?
- [ ] Can I maintain it solo, or do I need contributors?
- [ ] Are CI/CD and tests robust enough to prevent regressions?

## Token and Attention Efficiency
- [ ] Have I implemented selective JSON inclusion to reduce token usage (e.g., <500 tokens for targeted queries)?
- [ ] Do LLM prompts focus attention on relevant JSON fields, avoiding dilution?
- [ ] Have I tested summarized JSON outputs for broader queries?

## Strategic Fit
- [ ] Does LLMStruct align with my personal/business goals (e.g., learning, portfolio, startup)?
- [ ] Is the time investment proportionate to the expected impact (e.g., adoption, learning)?
- [ ] Can I pivot the project (e.g., to automation or metrics) if LLM use cases fade?

## Action Plan
- **If 70%+ boxes checked**: Continue with confidence, focusing on adoption and integrations.
- **If 50–70% checked**: Refine scope (e.g., fewer languages, leaner JSON) and test LLM value within 1 month.
- **If <50% checked**: Consider pivoting (e.g., to a niche tool) or pausing to explore other projects.
