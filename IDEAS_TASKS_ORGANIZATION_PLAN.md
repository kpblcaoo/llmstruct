## üéØ PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA & SCORING

```python
def calculate_task_priority_score(task):
    """Calculate comprehensive priority score for task"""
    
    # Impact factors (40% weight)
    user_impact = task.user_experience_improvement * 0.15
    business_impact = task.business_value * 0.15
    technical_impact = task.technical_advancement * 0.10
    
    # Effort factors (30% weight)
    complexity_score = (10 - task.complexity) * 0.15
    time_efficiency = (10 - task.estimated_hours) * 0.15
    
    # Strategic factors (20% weight)
    ai_assistance_potential = task.ai_friendly_score * 0.10
    dependency_criticality = task.blocking_other_tasks * 0.10
    
    # Risk factors (10% weight)
    implementation_risk = (10 - task.risk_level) * 0.05
    resource_availability = task.resource_match * 0.05
    
    return (user_impact + business_impact + technical_impact + 
            complexity_score + time_efficiency +
            ai_assistance_potential + dependency_criticality +
            implementation_risk + resource_availability)
