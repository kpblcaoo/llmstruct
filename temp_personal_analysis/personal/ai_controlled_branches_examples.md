# AI-Controlled Branches - Usage Examples and Scenarios

**Status**: Implementation Examples  
**Context**: Practical examples of AI branch workflows  
**Integration**: With existing 85% AI system

## 🚀 Basic Usage Examples

### Example 1: AI Creates CLI Command
```bash
# Human initiates
$ python -m llmstruct.cli ai-branch create TSK-145 \
    --description "Add new context optimization command" \
    --ai-agent github_copilot

# AI Branch Manager creates: ai/github_copilot/TSK-145-20250528T150000
# AI implements, tests, documents
# Human reviews and approves merge
```

### Example 2: Competitive Optimization
```bash
# Multiple AIs optimize same function
$ python -m llmstruct.cli ai-dogfood start competitive_optimization \
    --target-function "context_loading_optimization" \
    --competing-agents "github_copilot,claude,grok"

# Results in 3 different optimization approaches
# System automatically selects best based on performance + maintainability
```

### Example 3: Sequential Development Pipeline
```bash
# AI-1 codes → AI-2 reviews → AI-3 tests → AI-4 documents
$ python -m llmstruct.cli ai-dogfood start sequential_development \
    --task "implement_ai_metrics_dashboard" \
    --sequence "github_copilot,claude,gpt-4,claude"

# Fully automated development pipeline with human oversight points
```
