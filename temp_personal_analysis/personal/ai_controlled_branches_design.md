**Status**: Design Phase  
**Priority**: High  
**Integration**: Builds on existing 85% AI Self-Awareness system  
**Date**: 2025-05-28

## üéØ Executive Summary

Design and implementation strategy for fully AI-controlled development branches with human oversight protocols. This builds on our existing AI self-awareness infrastructure to create autonomous development workflows with "wild dogfooding" capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Foundation

### Existing Infrastructure (85% Complete)
- ‚úÖ **AI Self-Awareness System** - 6 operational components  
- ‚úÖ **CLI Integration** - 21 integrated commands
- ‚úÖ **Context Orchestration** - Smart context loading
- ‚úÖ **Capability Discovery** - Real-time system monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Processing Queue** - Task automation system
- ‚úÖ **Constraint System** - Safety and limits

### Required Extensions
- üîÑ **Branch Management AI** - Autonomous git operations
- üîÑ **Multi-AI Orchestrator** - Different AI system coordination
- üîÑ **Testing Automation** - AI-driven test execution
- üîÑ **Human Oversight Interface** - Decision escalation system

## ü§ñ AI-Controlled Branch Workflow

### Phase 1: Branch Creation
```yaml
trigger: 
  - Issue/Task assignment
  - Idea conversion (from ideas.json)
  - Automated opportunity detection

ai_actions:
  - Analyze requirements from context
  - Create feature branch with descriptive name
  - Initialize branch documentation
  - Set up testing environment
  - Configure monitoring

example: "feature/ai-branch-TSK-145-context-optimization"
```

### Phase 2: Development Execution
```yaml
ai_development_loop:
  1. Context Analysis:
     - Load project context (struct.json)
     - Analyze current codebase state
     - Review related issues/tasks
  
  2. Code Generation:
     - Generate implementation plan
     - Write code following patterns
     - Update documentation
     - Create/update tests
  
  3. Validation:
     - Run automated tests
     - Validate against constraints
     - Check code quality metrics
     - Performance validation

  4. Iteration:
     - Address test failures
     - Refine implementation
     - Update based on metrics
```

### Phase 3: Human Escalation Points
```yaml
escalation_triggers:
  breaking_changes: "Requires human approval"
  security_impact: "Mandatory human review"
  architectural_changes: "Consultation required"
  scope_expansion: "Re-approval needed"
  test_failures: "After 3 AI attempts"
  performance_degradation: ">10% regression"

escalation_process:
  1. Pause AI development
  2. Generate comprehensive report
  3. Create GitHub issue for review
  4. Await human decision
  5. Resume or abort based on feedback
```

## üî¨ Wild Dogfooding Framework

### Multi-AI System Testing
```yaml
ai_combinations:
  primary_workers:
