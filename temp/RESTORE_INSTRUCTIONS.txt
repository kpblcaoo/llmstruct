🧠 QUICK AI CONTEXT RESTORATION
================================

AFTER CURSOR RESTART, DO THIS:

1. 📖 READ CONTEXT:
   Open and read: temp/restore_ai_context.md

2. 🔄 QUICK CHECK:
   Run: python temp/quick_restore.py

3. 🏥 HEALTH CHECK:
   Run: python run_ai_diagnostics.py health

4. 🔧 IF TERMINAL ISSUES:
   Run: python debug_terminal.py

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ WorkflowOrchestrator: Fully integrated
✅ System Health: 11/11 tests passed  
✅ Performance: 0.03-0.13s response time
⚠️  Terminal: Output visibility issues in Cursor

WHAT WAS ACHIEVED:
- WorkflowOrchestrator integrated into start_development.py
- Fixed context loading through existing architecture
- Created fallback scripts for terminal issues
- Confirmed 100% system operational status
- Duplication analysis working (10.6% found)
